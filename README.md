# Program development

## Problem statement:
Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine the sum nearest to but not exceeding the
target that can be created. To create the sum, use any element of your array zero or more times.


### Solutions:

 - Solution.java:  Here the input is read from command line arguments. Scanner library is used for the same. The computation logic to find array is devised through Recursion.<br />
 - Solution2.java: Here the input is read from File system. BufferReader, File InputStreamReader are used. Math function is used to solve the given problem statement<br />
 - Solution3.java:  Use Multi-Dimensional array to computing the solution. Here a small demostration of lamda function is used in while loop to read the input parameters. <br />
